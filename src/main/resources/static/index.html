	<h2>TaskSpace</h2>
	<h3>Who are we?</h3>
	<p>TaskSpace is a collaboration tool, built off of the simplistic and straightforward ideas behind the SCRUM/Agile methodology that is becoming very prominent in development scenarios in both businesses, independent projects today.</p>	
	<p>TaskSpace is a place to keep track of both your individual goals and progress and for the team as a whole. TaskSpace items and personal assigned tasks are shown to every team member, this allows for transparency on individual progress to the team and encourages people to assist with items they may have previous experience in.</p>
